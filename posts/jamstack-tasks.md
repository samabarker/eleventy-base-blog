For information on the Jamstack bootcamp, see [this blog post](https://sambarker.uk/posts/jamstack-bootcamp-2021/). Each session usually has a series of tasks to be completed to demonstrate the skills learned in that session. My outputs for each of these sessions can be found below.

* Semantic HTML and Accessibility - Build and style a table using semantic HTML. View on [Github](https://github.com/samabarker/semantic-html-challenge) or [Github Pages](https://samabarker.github.io/semantic-html-challenge/).
* Frameworks - Create a HTML page using bootstrap to advertise your favourite band/musician. View on [Github](https://github.com/samabarker/eric-clapton) or [Github Pages](https://samabarker.github.io/eric-clapton/).
