I am currently lucky enough to be taking part in an 8 week Jamstack bootcamp run by [The Coders Guild](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/). Before starting this course, I had no idea what the Jamstack was. The bootcamp was advertised as providing the skills and knowledge necessary to take those with a basic understanding of web development to the next level, giving a deeper understanding of the technologies currently being used in the industry and hopefully opening up the opportunity to start a career in web development. I am currently in week 6 and am loving every minute of it.

The bootcamp started by giving an introduction to the Jamstack - described on [Jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/) as:

> an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity.

To those of us who had never heard the term Jamstack before, this seemed pretty daunting; this was soon resolved when it was explained what this actually meant in terms of web development:

* JavaScript to handle dynamic functionality
* API's to handle server side operations
* Markup to generate static sites

Before diving into this, the bootcamp trainers firstly covered some fundamentals - source control and Git, semantic HTML and accessibility, and frameworks such as Bootstrap. From here, we were introduced to static site generators and their benefits, with focus on creating a static site with 11ty and deploying with Netlify. Following this was a further session on Git workflows, giving us the opportunity to modify our static sites whilst solidifying our knowledge of Git. We were then introduced to content management systems, both generally and how to add a CMS to our static site.

From this point on, sessions have all covered introductory JavaScript, including basic programming concepts, functions and flow control.

I feel as though I have learned a great deal so far, and with five sessions still to go, I am excited to see what is to come. My code for each of the tasks set in the sessions can be found here.
