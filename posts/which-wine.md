A very simple application to help with pairing wine and food. The app is built using ReactJS, and makes use of 'state' to dynamically narrow down the potential wines based on what the user types into a seachbox. The wine list is imported from a JS file, which can easily be updated or replaced with an API output should it be needed. The app is styled using Bootstrap to make for a more pleasing user experience.
