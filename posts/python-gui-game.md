Each year, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) releases two mathematical problems each day throughout December. These problems start easy and get progressively harder throughout the month. They require the programmer to think logically and, in some cases, use specialist algorithms to get to the solution. This is the second year I have taken part in the challenge, and although I didn't complete them all this year, I was pretty proud with how far I got and what I learned along the way. I used Python to tackle the problems as it is my primary language.
