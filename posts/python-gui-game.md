After building a few games that can be played directly in the terminal, I wanted to have a play around with the PyGame package to build a more user friendly game.

* Dodge - A really simple first game where a 'player ship' has to avoid incoming 'enemy ships'. The enemy ships are randomly generated and have random speeds. There are 5 levels, getting incrementally more difficult in terms of number of enemies, enemy speeds and enemy sizes. The game keeps track of level, level score and overall score, all of which are displayed on the game screen. View on [Github](https://github.com/samabarker/pygames/blob/master/dodge.py) and [Repl](https://repl.it/@sambarkercom/dodge).
